## Overview and Origin:
Raiz Invest Limited is a fintech industry providing microinvesting options through customized fund portolios modelled using different risk profiles from conservative to agressive. RAIZ is currently listed on ASX having a total market capitlisation of $176 million.

Along with portfolio investments it also provides a rewards program in its app that allows customers to shop through the app and have a promotional sum invested back into their investment account. The company was incorporated in 2016 and was founded by George Lucas the current Managing Director and the Group CEO of Raiz Invest Limited. (Directors & Management - Raiz Invest, 2021)

George Lucas build this company to simply the process of investing that involved a lot of documentation, engaging a broker and the need for large initial capital which made investing difficult especially for people with no knowledge or background in Investing. Raiz enables an Investor to invest a sum as low as five dollars along with customized portfolios as per the indiciuals risk profile.(George Lucas - Raiz Invest, 2021).

As of FY2020 the total share capital stand at $31 million and total long term debt of just $250 thousand Australian dollars. (Editorial, 2021)

## Business Activities:
Most of the current  investment platform with major banks and financial instituions charge a brokerage for using their platform for share and other investment trading. This brokerage fee ranges from $5.00 to $20.00 per transactions. Also you need to have some knowledge and understanding on the kind of investments you chosse to be a part of your portfolio. Customers usually engage professional such as financial planners or brokers to bridge their knowledge gap. This process is costly , time consuming and can only be afforded by people who atleast have a minimum investment capital of $10,000 to $20,000.
Most of the investment platforms also ask you to invest a minium sum per transaction which is usually set at $500. 

Raiz overcomes a lot of these limitations in its app. The graphical user interface is fairly simple to understand where a customer casn choose how much they want to invest, what protfolio they want to invest and if they want to make  a recurring lumpsum every month. It also provides an option to invest all round up amounts of your banking/ credit card transactions which also gets added to your default chosen portfolio.

Raiz has had a strong growth in its consumer base over the course of the last 4 years. As of July 2021, the total number of consumers sign ups in Australia stand at 1,114,363 and the New Southeast Asia division also 464,882 customer sign ups
The total combined funds under management amounts to $904 million and the company aims and is on track to increase the number to 1 billion by the end of the calendar year 2021.(ASX Announcements - Raiz Invest, 2021)

Raiz uses cloud technology to agrregate all orders placed on the app which needs clearing and uses algoritiums for automatic asset allocation(Raiz Invest-Investor Centre, 2021). Raiz has patnerened with Envestnet Yodlee that helps run the round ups function within its app which has to date invested around $300 million in cutomer portfolios using its data aggregation platform. (Yodlee, 2021). Raiz patnered  with the University of NSW to develop a machine learning engine for its rewards program within the app that has over 165 particpating merchants that customers can buy from in return for cashback amounts invested directly into their portfolio accounts(Boost program helps Raiz partner with UNSW to develop new customer technology - Support for businesses, 2021). From an IT security standpoint, Raiz uses Versive Security Engine (VSE) to help protect sensitive customer data and for financial complaince. VSE provides continuous situational awareness inside customer network and detects internal and external adversaries regardless of what new tools, tactics or exploits hackers may use.VSE also uses AI for to automatically uncover the required chain of potential threat activity that separates the signal—the real risks to Raiz’s business and customer information—from normal network noise.(Raiz Security: Strengthens Financial Security and Compliance with AI Cybersecurity, 2021).
