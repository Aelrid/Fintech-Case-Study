## Overview and Origin:
Raiz Invest Limited is a fintech company providing micro-investing options through customized fund portfolios modeled using different risk profiles from conservative to aggressive. RAIZ is currently listed on ASX, having a total market capitalization of $176 million.

Along with portfolio investments, it also provides a rewards program in its app that allows customers to shop and have a promotional sum invested back into their investment account. The company was incorporated in 2016 and was founded by George Lucas, the current Managing Director and the Group CEO of Raiz Invest Limited. (Directors & Management - Raiz Invest, 2021)

George Lucas built this company to simplify the process of investing that involved complex documentation, engaging a broker, and the need for significant initial capital, which made investing challenging, especially for people with no knowledge or background in Investing. Instead, Raiz enables an Investor to invest a sum as low as five dollars in customized portfolios per the individual's risk profile. (George Lucas - Raiz Invest, 2021).

As of FY2020, the total company share capital stands at $31 million and has a long-term debt of just $250 thousand. (Editorial, 2021) which makes their net asset position quite strong.

## Business Activities:
Most of the current investment platforms provided by major banks and financial institutions charge a brokerage to use their services for trading shares and other investments. This brokerage fee ranges from $5.00 to $20.00 per transaction. Also, you need to have some knowledge and understanding of the kind of investments you choose to be a part of your portfolio. Customers usually engage professionals such as financial planners or brokers to bridge their knowledge gap. This process is costly, time-consuming, and can only be afforded by people who at least have minimum investment capital of $10,000 to $20,000. Most investment platforms also ask you to invest a minimum sum per transaction, typically set at $500.

Raiz overcomes a lot of these limitations in its app. The graphical user interface is relatively simple to understand where a customer can choose how much they want to invest, what portfolio they want to invest, and if they want to make a recurring lump sum every month. It also provides an option to invest all round-up amounts of your banking/ credit card transactions, which get added to your default chosen portfolio.

Raiz has had strong growth in its consumer base over the last four years. As of July 2021, the total number of consumer sign-ups in Australia stands at 1,114,363. The New Southeast Asia division also has 464,882 customer sign-ups. The total combined funds under management amount to $904 million to date. The company aims and is on track to increase the number to 1 billion by the end of 2021. (ASX Announcements - Raiz Invest, 2021)

Raiz uses cloud technology to aggregate all orders placed on the app, which needs clearing and algorithms for automatic asset allocation(Raiz Invest-Investor Centre, 2021). Raiz has partnered with Envestnet Yodlee that helps run the round-ups function within its app, which has invested around $300 million in customer portfolios using its data aggregation platform. (Yodlee, 2021). In addition to this, Raiz partnered with the University of NSW to develop a machine learning engine for its rewards program within the app that has over 165 participating merchants. Customers can shop with the merchant through the app in return for cashback amounts invested directly into their portfolio accounts.(Boost program helps Raiz partner with UNSW to develop new customer technology - Support for businesses, 2021). From an IT security standpoint, Raiz uses Versive Security Engine (VSE) to help protect sensitive customer data and for financial compliance. VSE provides continuous situational awareness inside the customer network and detects internal and external adversaries regardless of the new tools, tactics, or exploits hackers may use.VSE also uses AI to automatically uncover the required chain of potential threat activity that separates the signal—the real risks to Raiz's business and customer information—from normal network noise. (Raiz Security: Strengthens Financial Security and Compliance with AI Cybersecurity, 2021).
