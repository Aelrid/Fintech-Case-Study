![](https://www.finder.com.au/niche-builder/5b19f2f6ba8c1.png)

## Overview and Origin:
Raiz Invest Limited is a fintech industry providing micro-investing options through customized fund portfolios modeled using different risk profiles from conservative to aggressive. RAIZ is currently listed on ASX, having a total market capitalisation of $176 million.

Along with portfolio investments, it also provides a rewards program in its app that allows customers to shop and have a promotional sum invested back into their investment account. The company was incorporated in 2016 and was founded by George Lucas, the current Managing Director and the Group CEO of Raiz Invest Limited. (Directors & Management - Raiz Invest, 2021)

George Lucas builds this company to simplify the process of investing that involved a lot of documentation, engaging a broker, and the need for significant initial capital, which made investing challenging, especially for people with no knowledge or background in Investing. Instead, Raiz enables an Investor to invest a sum as low as five dollars and customized portfolios per the individual risk profile. (George Lucas - Raiz Invest, 2021).

As of FY2020, the total share capital stands at $31 million and total long-term debt of just $250 thousand. (Editorial, 2021)

## Business Activities:
Most of the current investment platforms with major banks and financial institutions charge a brokerage for using their platform for share and other financial investments. This brokerage fee ranges from $5.00 to $20.00 per transaction. Also, you need to have some knowledge and understanding of the kind of investments you choose to be a part of your portfolio. Customers usually engage professionals such as financial planners or brokers to bridge their knowledge gap. This process is costly, time-consuming, and can only be afforded by people who at least have minimum investment capital of $10,000 to $20,000.
Most investment platforms also ask you to invest a minimum sum per transaction, usually set at $500. 

Raiz overcomes a lot of these limitations in its app. The graphical user interface is relatively simple to understand where a customer can choose how much they want to invest, what portfolio they want to invest, and if they want to make a recurring lump sum every month. It also provides an option to invest all round-up amounts of your banking/ credit card transactions, which get added to your default chosen portfolio.

Raiz has had strong growth in its consumer base over the last four years. As of July 2021, the total number of consumer sign-ups in Australia stands at 1,114,363, and the New Southeast Asia division also has 464,882 customer sign-ups
The total combined funds under management amount to $904 million, and the company aims and is on track to increase the number to 1 billion by the end of the calendar year 2021. (ASX Announcements - Raiz Invest, 2021)

Raiz uses cloud technology to aggregate all orders placed on the app, which needs clearing and algorithms for automatic asset allocation(Raiz Invest-Investor Centre, 2021). Raiz has partnered with Envestnet Yodlee that helps run the round-ups function within its app, which has invested around $300 million in customer portfolios using its data aggregation platform. (Yodlee, 2021). In addition, Raiz partnered with the University of NSW to develop a machine learning engine for its rewards program within the app that has over 165 participating merchants that customers can buy from in return for cashback amounts invested directly into their portfolio accounts(Boost program helps Raiz partner with UNSW to develop new customer technology - Support for businesses, 2021). From an IT security standpoint, Raiz uses Versive Security Engine (VSE) to help protect sensitive customer data and financial compliance. VSE provides continuous situational awareness inside the customer network and detects internal and external adversaries regardless of the new tools, tactics, or exploits hackers may use.VSE also uses AI to automatically uncover the required chain of potential threat activity that separates the signal—the real risks to Raiz's business and customer information—from normal network noise.

## Competitors: 

Some of the major competitors in this space are Commsec pockets, Spaceship Voyager and Sharesies. All of the apps promote passive investing among retail investors. The below table summarizes the differences in services and costs.

### Cost and Product Analysis:
Raiz is currently the most expensive of the lot. Still, it provides greater flexibility in modeling your portfolio and runs a rewards program through which online shopping could easily add to your portfolio balance to cover the minimum monthly fee. Raiz also provides superannuation services, thus providing retail clients greater flexibility over their retirement savings. The rewards program is also available for superannuation programs. The biggest highlight for Raiz would be offering cryptocurrency exposure in their portfolio which is currently not supported by the other competitors. Commsec pocket, on the other hand, even though it has quite a low investment fee, only provides an ETF investment option.
Given that it's backed by one of Australia's biggest banks, the site will be the most trusted service provider among the other companies. Spaceship voyage has also been quite popular among retail investors and currently has more than $1 billion under management. It provides managed share portfolios in different categories, namely Universe, Origin, and Earth (Spaceship, 2021). These portfolios consist of shares of top companies of the world and companies which have had a positive impact. This is a good investment option for retail customers who don't mind the risk of having all their money invested in shares and don't want to pay a fee for their small investment portfolios. Sharesies is the only micro-investing company that allows you to buy direct shares, ETF, and managed funds without a minimum investment threshold and is cheaper than other share trading platforms available in the market today. Sharesies will be a good option for investors who want to start investing in shares with little capital or investors looking to reduce their brokerage fee. Based on the current brokerage fee charged by the big four banks, a minimum of $20 for every $1000 transaction. Sharesies will only cost you $4.98 per $1000 (Pricing—Sharesies Australia, 2021)


### Financials and KPI's:
Companies use two primary metrics to measure their success in this sector. Firstly it aims to have more funds under management, active customers, and transactions.
Each of the micro-investing companies has different ways of charging a fee. For example, in the case of Raiz, it charges the client a monthly account maintenance fee, and hence the more active customers, the more revenue it will generate for the company.
Based on the latest statistics released by Raiz in July, the current active customers stand at 282,419 in Australia and  202,556 in Southeast Asia, with a total of $904 million funds under management

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87921076/129890288-4a83e714-fb31-4192-81f6-890d0fac864a.png)

Given the minimum account fee for monthly account maintenance is $3.5/month. If Raiz successfully maintains the current active customer numbers, the current revenue in Australia alone will stand at least $12 million a year. Raiz revenue has increased over the years but has not reached its breakeven yet. Raiz is yet to release its audited financials for FY2021, and given the growth, we can expect Raiz to be profitable this year.

In comparison to other companies, Spaceship, and Spaceship voyager claim to have more than $1 billion funds under management. Given that they are not a public company, it's hard to ascertain the revenue generated by each of them as they charge fees differently to Raiz. 

### Portfolio Performance
The other important factor in maintaining a healthy customer base is providing portfolio options that have generated good average returns over the years. Given that market correction due to the pandemic, most of the Raiz portfolios did not perform too great, but neither did they lose too much value in the FY2019-2020. On the contrary, the portfolios have picked up pace in the second half of FY2020 and provided attractive returns as per information specified on Raiz's website. It follows the modern portfolio theory for modelling the ETF portfolios.

On the other hand, the returns on Commsec pocket and Sharesies depend on the investments you choose and are not modelled by fund managers.

The share portfolios modelled by Spaceship voyager provided an annual return of up to 46% as of the year ended June 2021. But it's important to note that the recovery from the pandemic lows and any adverse market movements can lead to an Investor losing a lot of their investment sum as the portfolio is not diversified with low-risk investments such as bonds, cash, etc.(Investment Performance, 2021)

All in all, this puts Raiz in a powerful position. Most retail investors would like to dread carefully when they are new to investing and would like some flexibility to switch portfolios based on market conditions.

## Recommendations:
In comparison to its competitors, the biggest area that Raiz misses out on would be the ability to buy shares directly from its app. Many users would like to model their portfolios through ETFs and by having a part of it invested in some direct shares of their choice. Having this feature will make Raiz very competitive in the market. Raiz can also have some custom modelled share portfolios using the modern portfolio theory, which can run on AI and constantly adjust to market conditions. 

If Raiz wishes to go a step further in its rewards program, it can incorporate cryptocurrencies as cashback rewards for shopping with the listed merchants. This will also be a good strategy for merchants to promote sales given the popularity of blockchain with young retail customers. Raiz can charge a fee to Merchants for providing this service. 

Raiz can extend its cloud program to shares as well to accept orders and for clearing functions. Raiz already offers cryptocurrencies investment through their Sapphire portfolio, so incorporating the rewards program would be flexible.

Overall, Raiz constantly updates its app to offer new services, from superannuation services to crypto investments. The addition of the Sapphire (bitcoin) portfolio has been popular among investors and has provided good returns since its inception. As a result, Raiz is well-positioned in the market to expand its customer base and deliver positive results for FY2022.
